# unsupervised_learning_challenge

A prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. Based on their raw data, I fit machine learning models through data processing. Since there is no known classification system, I used unsupervised learning. I used several clustering algorithms to explore whether the cryptocurrencies can be grouped together with other similar cryptocurrencies. I used data visualization to share your findings with the investment bank.
